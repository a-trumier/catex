# CATEX

A lightweight and straightforward C library for generating LaTeX documents. This project is designed to be simple, flexible, and easy to use, making it ideal for those who want to integrate LaTeX generation into their C projects or create custom variations of the library.

## Features

- **Single Header File**: Everything you need is in one header file for convenience and ease of integration.
- **Minimalistic Design**: No complex dependencies—just plain C code.
- **Customizable**: Designed for users to copy, rewrite, and adapt the library for their own use cases.
- **Focus on Simplicity**: Ideal for those who value a clean and understandable codebase.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the header file (`simple_latex.h`) into your project directory.
2. Include the header in your C code:
   ```c
   #include "catex.h
   ```
This will generate a file output.tex that you can compile with pdflatex or similar tools.

## Installation
No installation is necessary—just copy the header file into your project.

2. Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
3. Fork the project and make your own variations.

## Why Another LaTeX Library?
Many existing libraries are powerful but overly complex for small projects or learning purposes. This library focuses on simplicity and adaptability, empowering developers to tailor it to their needs or learn from its straightforward design.
